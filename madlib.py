#  Madlib project
# sring concatenations variations (aka how to put strings together)
# 3 different ways to format strings are as follows:
# we wanted to create a string that says: 'subscribe to python Engineers bootcamp'
# x = "python Engineers bootcamp"

# So a few ways to write that would be:
print("subsribe to ") # concatenation
print("subsribe to  ") # str.format()
print("subscribe to") # F-string
